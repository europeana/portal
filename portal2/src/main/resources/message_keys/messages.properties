# if you do not want the translators to see a tag in the multilingo tool, but you want to
# use the tag programmatically, e.g., a url, the the marcoms can place the tag in the multilingo

featured-item-1_img_alt_t					= Attributed to French School , Portrait of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy
featured-item-1_p_t							= In 1419 Philip became Duke of Burgundy after his father was assassinated. Philip held the dauphin Charles (who later became Charles VII of France) responsible for his father's murder and signed treaties with England against France in defiance of the French King. His real interest, however, lay in swallowing up the smaller dukedoms of Namur, Hainaut, Brabant, Luxembourg and the combined countries of Holland and Zeeland. He was extremely sucessful and it was under his rule that the richness and extravagance of the Burgundian court reached its height. He was one of the most cultured and wealthy of all medieval rulers. In 1430 Philip founded a new order of chivalry, The Order of the Golden Fleece, a Burgundian version of the British Order of the Garter which also alluded to the international wool and textile trade that was the foundation of his prosperity. It was established in celebration of the prosperous and wealthy domains he had united and that extended from Flanders to Switzerland. In Philip's portrait shown here, and in all known portraits of him, he is proudly wearing the symbols of the Order of the Golden Fleece around his neck, a sheep and two crowns.Given the longevity of the order, which Philippe initiated, and the public interest in him as a historical figure, it is probable that many images of Philippe the Good were produced throughout France during the fifteenth and even sixteenth centuries.

featured-item-2_p_t							= In 1419 Philip became Duke of Burgundy after his father was assassinated. Philip held the dauphin Charles (who later became Charles VII of France) responsible for his father's murder and signed treaties with England against France in defiance of the French King. His real interest, however, lay in swallowing up the smaller dukedoms of Namur, Hainaut, Brabant, Luxembourg and the combined countries of Holland and Zeeland. He was extremely sucessful and it was under his rule that the richness and extravagance of the Burgundian court reached its height. He was one of the most cultured and wealthy of all medieval rulers. In 1430 Philip founded a new order of chivalry, The Order of the Golden Fleece, a Burgundian version of the British Order of the Garter which also alluded to the international wool and textile trade that was the foundation of his prosperity. It was established in celebration of the prosperous and wealthy domains he had united and that extended from Flanders to Switzerland. In Philip's portrait shown here, and in all known portraits of him, he is proudly wearing the symbols of the Order of the Golden Fleece around his neck, a sheep and two crowns.Given the longevity of the order, which Philippe initiated, and the public interest in him as a historical figure, it is probable that many images of Philippe the Good were produced throughout France during the fifteenth and even sixteenth centuries.
